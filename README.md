# about:blank cloaker
This repo is a complete (as far as i know) guide for about:blank cloaking
## about:blank cloaker for website
index.html and web-aboutblank.js are files for this, the index.html is just the code for the button and the web-aboutblank.js is for actually opening the page.
## about:blank cloaker current page
bookmarklet-aboutblank.js is the bookmarklet file, just activate it to make the current page about:blank
> [!WARNING]
> this bookmarklet doesn't work with some URLs, this can't be fixed
## about:blank cloaker custom URL
custom-bookmarklet-aboutblank.js is the bookmarklet file, and it prompts you to enter the endpoint URL
> [!WARNING]
> this bookmarklet doesn't work with some URLs, this can't be fixed (also if you're on a website that doesn't work for the current page bookmarklet, this bookmarklet won't open the page)

## important info for the about:blank bookmarklets
almost all pages will open in about:blank if they went into about:blank from that page, but testing is still happening on what pages let their page be displayed. <br>
